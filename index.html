    <h2><strong>Bio</strong></h2>
      <p>Hello world! I am Marisol Jimenez-Garcia. I am from Tukwila Washington, and am pleased to introduce myself.

      <h2><strong>Education and Experience</strong></h2>
      <p>I am going to <em>Foster High School</em> located in Tukwila as a rising sophomore.
        Hopefully, this year turns out alright, as the last one was pretty hectice what with Covid ;-;.
        Currently I'm attending a 4 week program to help me learn more about social justice, conflict,
        and representation in the world and what I can do to help make change for the better.
        I enjoy looking for these kinds of meaningful programs to help me increase my understanding of
        the world around me, and hopefully help others in the process too!
